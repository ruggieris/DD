Discrimination Discovery

A Python version of the Discrimination Discovery approach of [[1]](#references), including independence and separation fairness metrics. Original implementation in SQL/Java was in the DCUBE system [[2]](#references), now discontinued. An alternative implementation (less metrics, more algorithms) is available in Java [[1]](#references) from [my home page](http://pages.di.unipi.it/ruggieri/software.html), but it is discontinued as well in favor of this Python version.
